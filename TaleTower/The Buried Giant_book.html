            <pre>Description : it is a fantasy novel by Kazuo Ishiguro that follows
              an elderly Briton couple, Axl and Beatrice, as they journey to a 
              neighboring village to seek out their son. Along the way, they encounter
              a host of characters, including a Saxon warrior named Wistan and the 
              elderly Sir Gawain, and become embroiled in a larger conflict involving
              a she-dragon and the lingering effects of King Arthur's reign. The novel
              explores themes of memory, trauma, and the consequences of violence, as 
              the characters navigate a world where a mist has caused a collective amnesia,
              blurring the lines between truth and myth. The novel is a unique blend of
              historical and fantastical elements,and has been praised for its lyrical 
              prose and thought-provoking themes.   </pre>
