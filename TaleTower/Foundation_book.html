            <pre>Description :  The Foundation series is a collection of science fiction
               novels and short stories written by Isaac Asimov . The series is composed 
               of several books,with the first one being"Foundation,"which is the starting
               point of the Foundation trilogy . This first book consists of five short 
               stories,the first of which was written by Asimov in 1950 as an introduction
               to the series.The other four stories were originally published in Astounding
               Science Fiction magazine.

               The story begins on Synnax, where Gaal Dornick is preparing to travel to Trantor,
               the capital planet of the Galactic Empire. The empire,despite its long history and
               appearance of stability, has been declining for centuries. Hari Seldon,a mathematician
               who has developed the science of psychohistory,predicts the empire's downfall and 
               seeks to establish a project to shorten the subsequent 30,000-year period of anarchy 
               to just 1,000 years. Seldon and his team are eventually exiled to Terminus, a remote 
               planet on the edge of the galaxy,to work on the Encyclopedia Galactica</pre>
