            <pre>Description : Empress of the Nile is a biography of Christiane Desroches-Noblecourt,
              a renowned French Egyptologist who made significant contributions to the field of Egyptology.
              Born in 1913, Desroches-Noblecourt fought to protect the Louvre's treasures during the Nazi
              occupation of France, and later became one of the world's greatest Egyptologists. She made 
              major discoveries, played a key role in saving the ancient Nubian temple of Abu Simbel, and
              was involved in bringing the treasures of Tutankhamun for tours in the west. The book highlights
              her defiance of the Nazis, her groundbreaking work in Egyptology,
              and her significant contributions to preserving ancient Egyptian history. </pre>
