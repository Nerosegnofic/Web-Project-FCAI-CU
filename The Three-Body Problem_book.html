        <h3><p>Author : Liu Cixin</p></h3>
        <h3><pre>Description : The Three-Body Problem is a science fiction novel
              written by Liu Cixin that tells the story of humanity's first contact
              with an alien civilization. The novel is set in China and follows the 
              lives of several characters, including Ye Wenjie, a physicist who becomes
              disillusioned with humanity after witnessing the atrocities of the Cultural 
              Revolution. Ye sends a message into space inviting alien life to Earth,
              leading to the arrival of the Trisolarans, an advanced civilization from a 
              distant star system. 
            
              The Trisolarans are facing a crisis as their planet orbits three suns,
              causing unpredictable climate changes that threaten their existence. 
              They plan to invade Earth and make it their new home, but their advanced
              technology is based on an understanding of physics that is incompatible
              with Earth's. The novel explores the cultural and scientific differences
              between the two civilizations and raises questions about humanity's place
              in the universe. The Trisolarans' advanced technology includes "sophons,"
              particles that can disrupt particle accelerators and cause hallucinations,
              making it difficult for humans to resist their invasion.The novel won the 
              Hugo Award for Best Novel in 2015, becoming the first Asian novel to do so.</pre></h3>
