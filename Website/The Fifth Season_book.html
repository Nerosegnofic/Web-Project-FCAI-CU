        <h3><p>Author : N. K. Jemisin</p></h3>
        <h3><pre>Description : it is a fantasy novel by N.K. Jemisin that takes place
              in a world called the Stillness, a land plagued by constant seismic 
              activity and ashfall. The story follows three orogenes, people with the
              ability to manipulate the earth, as they navigate a society that fears 
              and oppresses them. Essun, a woman seeking revenge for the murder of her
              son; Damaya, a young girl learning to control her powers at a training center;
              and Syenite, a powerful orogene forced to breed more of her kind, each have 
              their own stories that intertwine in a complex narrative about power, oppression,
              and survival. The novel explores themes of dehumanization, survival,
              and the consequences of violence in a world where natural disasters are the norm.   </pre></h3>
