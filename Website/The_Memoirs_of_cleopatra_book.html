        <h3><p>Author : Margaret George </p></h3>
        <h3><pre>Description : The Memoirs of Cleopatra is a historical fiction novel
              written by Margaret George, which tells the story of Cleopatra VII, 
              Queen of Egypt, from her early life under her father's rule to her 
              eventual suicide. The novel follows Cleopatra's journey from her 
              co-rule with her father, to her marriage with her brother Ptolemy 
              XIII, to her tryst with Julius Caesar, and her affair with Marcus 
              Antonius. George's novel is considered to be historically accurate and
              aims to depict Cleopatra as a political leader rather than the flighty
              character portrayed in Roman propaganda and Shakespearean plays.
              The novel was published in 1997 and was adapted into a four-part mini
              series by ABC in 1999.  </pre></h3>
